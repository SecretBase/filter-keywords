The software allows auto import of customer data from many sites and shipping rates are automatically applied if filters and rules have been set up. However I'd caution anyone who is looking for shipping software to shop around. Shipstation offers no phone support, the software has difficulty automatically splitting applying shipping rates to orders containing multiple items, and the bulk import tool sucks. This means that if you have lots of customers that buy multiple items, you're still doing a lot of manual sorting. Also, if you run a Kickstarter campaign, for example, and need to import several hundred orders VIA .csv, you're going to run into problems."

I'm a stay at home mom of two little boys and started my own clothing line for new moms. I was sending a couple of orders a week to friends and family by going to the post office. Business picked up to four or five orders a week and I started printing shipping online. Then we ran our first ad on Facebook and things took off. Shipstation no joke changed my life. I have managed to keep up with over 200 orders a week (and keep my babies alive) by using the program. I can even make scrambled eggs and print postage at the same time. I can't get over how easily it works alongside Shopify and how easy it is to learn how how to use. Seriously if you are using anything else right now, stop- and bring Shipstation on board. Sometimes at the end of the night when I go to sleep all caught up on orders, I send a little virtual hug to Texas. Seriously, my company would still be a little hobby if it wasn't for Shipstation. "

We loved the integration with our existing USPS postage account (via DYMO) and the customer service and technical support reps have been fantastic. Quick to respond and very helpful, taking the time to address a question we had. Highly recommended. A must have app, really."

I'm glad that shipstation now supports shopify. the interface is very nice and easy to navigate. you can even track sales! it also saves me money since i didn't have to sign up for two separate accounts for both my shopify stores. the usps rate is also much lower than any services I've ever used had to offer."

This has made a world of difference in productivity.  It's a fantastic interface, very user friendly, and the rates are competitive.  It truly has helped us manage our workflow."

      "message": "Great tool! It's reliable and integrates various shipping providers with ease. It could use some enhancements though. The inability to correct an order's product selection is frustrating. At the moment the only way to change the order is to manually remove the order and add a new replacement. An import feature for addresses would be great. Ability to reorder the rows and save the format. And finally, not sure if it's a Mac Safari specific issue but when scrolling down in the application the window also scrolls with a slight horizontal movement. Making it scroll diagonally. This is really frustrating and should be looked into asap. Otherwise, great product. Keep it up!"

Now I use ship station and it takes me minutes.  Their tools are user friendly and link directly with my shopify store so I don't have to think about updating information. It does it all automatically and sends my customers tracking info."

Lets me even track sales. Sends tracking numbers to customers, awesome. Just works really well & it's easy to use. There are some minor things I'd like changed, but it seems to be 1,000 times better than anything else I've found."
